Data Engineer
-------------

As a private equity research analyst, I spent 2 years working on various financial projects, analyzing data and conducting research to inform investment decisions. While I enjoyed this role and gained valuable skills in financial analysis and data interpretation, I realized that I wanted to explore a different career path that allowed me to focus on my strengths in creative problem-solving and data analysis. After researching different roles in the tech industry, I discovered the field of data engineering and saw that it aligned perfectly with my skills and interests. I began learning about data engineering concepts and technologies, such as SQL, Python, and ETL pipelines and was drawn to this role's challenging and rewarding nature. I am now transitioning into a career as a data engineer, using my skills in research and numerical analysis to design and build scalable data systems and pipelines. I am excited to apply my problem-solving skills to new challenges in this field and to continue learning and growing in my career.
