# üëã Welcome

My name is **Shafkat Rahman**, a **Full-Stack Developer** passionate about building meaningful software solutions that solve real-world problems. My journey into software development is unique‚Äîgrounded in **physics, shaped by finance, and driven by technology**.

I hold a **Bachelor's degree in Physics from Concordia University, Montr√©al**, where I conducted **undergraduate research in computational physics**. After graduation, I spent **2 years as a Private Equity Research Analyst**, honing my skills in **data analysis, research methodology, and problem-solving** in high-stakes financial environments.

In **2022**, I made the leap into programming, completing **Le Wagon's Data Science bootcamp** and immersing myself in software development. The emergence of **generative AI in 2024-2025** accelerated my learning, and I've been building **production-ready applications** ever since. While I'm early in my professional development career, my foundation in **computational thinking, analytical rigor, and continuous learning** drives me to create **impactful, user-centered solutions**.

## Current Projects

### **EchoCall** ‚Äì AI Companion for Seniors
An AI-powered conversational assistant designed to combat **loneliness and social isolation** among seniors. EchoCall provides **empathetic, natural conversations** using advanced language models, helping elderly users stay connected and engaged.

**Focus Areas:** AI/ML integration, conversational design, accessibility, user experience for non-technical audiences

### **Service Pronto** ‚Äì Restaurant QR Code Ordering System
A full-stack application enabling **seamless digital ordering** for restaurants through QR code technology. Currently under development with commercial deployment planned.

**Tech Stack:** Full-stack development, payment integration, real-time order management
_(Details limited due to NDA)_

## Education & Background

- **B.Sc. in Physics** ‚Äì Concordia University, Montr√©al
  - **Computational Physics Research** (Undergraduate)
- **Data Science Bootcamp** ‚Äì Le Wagon
- **Private Equity Research Analyst** ‚Äì 2 years of professional experience in financial analysis and data-driven decision making

## Philosophy

I believe in **consistency, hard work, and never giving up**. What excites me most about software engineering is the **ability to build**‚Äîto transform ideas into tangible solutions that make people's lives better. My background in **physics taught me to think systematically**, finance **taught me to solve complex problems under pressure**, and development **gives me the tools to create**.

I embrace **continuous learning** and view every challenge as an opportunity to grow. The rapid evolution of AI and development tools has democratized software creation, and I'm committed to leveraging these technologies to build **innovative, accessible, and impactful applications**.
